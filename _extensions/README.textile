h1. HAML Jekyll extension

Auto-generates html and css files for your layouts in HAML/SASS (you can still have your liquid syntax)

This extension uses "_jekyll_ext_":http://github.com/rfelix/jekyll_ext, which allows you to extend the Jekyll static blog generator without forking and modifying it's codebase. 
With this code, not only do your extensions live in your blog directory, but they can also be shared and reutilized.

Use this extension with _jekyll_ext_ by just cloning this repo into the <em>_extensions</em> dir of your blog: <code>git clone git://github.com/codegram/haml_jekyll_extension.git _extensions</code>

More information about _jekyll_ext_ can be found here: "Jekyll Extensions -= Pain":http://rfelix.com/2010/01/19/jekyll-extensions-minus-equal-pain/
